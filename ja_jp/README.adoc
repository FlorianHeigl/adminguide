This repository contains the code necessary to build the Zimbra
Administration Guide in Japanese.

This guide is intended for system administrators responsible for
installing, maintaining, and supporting the server deployment of
Zimbra.

== Building the Documentation

Please refer to the link:../README.adoc[Master README] about the preparation
of Asciidoctor.

Once you have Asciidoctor installed and working, you can build the
documentation into HTML files like so:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 -D ~/temp/{product-version} -o {doc-filename}-{product-version}.html ja_jp/index.adoc
----

This assumes you have a "temp" directory to receive the asciidoctor output,
and are generating output for version {product-version}... adjust according to your
situation.
Each section of the document is contained in its own file. You may use the
`index.adoc` file to generate the entire document.

To accompany the HTML output, the `images/` folder must also be copied to the output destination:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
-----
cp -r ./images/ja_jp ~/temp/{product-version}/images/
-----

When publishing the output (gh-pages branch) the index.html needs to be updated to
point at the generated Japanese version.
